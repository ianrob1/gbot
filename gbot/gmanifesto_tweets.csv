"The Most Insane Thing is No One Talks about this.  In History of Internet.  Internet sucks.  Should be Called ""Inter-soy"".  Zero good info."
Really Think Hard about of Every Person who Sucks in Your Life:   non-smoker/non-drinker  Huge Lesson in there.  No one Talks about this.
I do Not give a fuck if you Smoked and Drank Heavy for 20 years.  You Stop for one Minute?  Fuck You.  Soft.
Just Look at Every Single Internet non-smoker/non-drinker Dork out there.  All soy eaters.  Huge Lesson in there that No One will Call Out.

"We Tried this non-smoker/non-drinker thing.  Did Not Work.  We Need to go Back to Constant Booze, Constant  Smoking."
It Need to be Illegal to be a non-smoker/non-drinker.  Indoors or Outdoors.  This Law Needs to be Passed Now.  No one talks about this.
If You are Not Smoking and Boozing Constantly.  You can fuck off and go eat soy.  Zero Value.  non-smoker/non-drinkers = soy Eaters.
non-smoker/non-drinkers.  Not Men.  soy.
Everyone Gets Real Quiet if you say Anything Negative about non-smoker/non-drinkers.  Huge Lesson in there.
"I Will Talk to someone, if they do Not Spark Up a Smoke Or Drink Booze within 10 Minutes, I will Throw number in Trash.  Zero Value."
Lets All Be Real for a Moment.  Think of ANYTHING any non-smoker/non-drinker Has Even Said in History:  Nothing of Value.  All soy.
If You are not Smoking/Drinking you should Be Fined for Put in Jail.  This is The ONLY Way to Return The World to Glory.
We Need to Make it Illegal to b a non-smoker/non-drinker  We have Tried the other way  Big Mistake.  We Need to Fine non-smoker/non-drinkers
Think of Every Person who Sucks in Your Life:   non-smoker/non-drinker  Lesson in there.

"She has lived here 40 years, said she had traveled all over the world and right here is the most beautiful.  ""I agree"", I said."
"She saw me shadowboxing slow on the beach and said, ""Are u doing Karate?""  I said, no, just stretching. She said, I will join u.  Good Game."
"During my sunrise stretch, a super old Jewish lady came up and talked to me.  Had the greatest conversation with her."
Going to watch sunrise right now and workout.  Last night had drinks with Colombiana.  I live at beach. I wore a suit.  Unbeliveable I know.
Part II of interview with @RealCMcQueen will have the best path for making money for the young kids out there:https://realchristianmcqueen.com/2016/02/16/g-manifesto-interview-part-i/ …
"Remember:  Custom Suit Smoking Drinking  Living in a Town with Models Positivity  $  Qualifies as ""not believable"" 2 guys from D grade citys"
The funny thing about the methods to get more haters is that they are the exact same methods to living a fulfilling life.  Funny isnt it?
"Actually, should be:  3. Live at beach in model town with late last call &great nightlife  Then you can get your peers in LA & NYC hating 2"
4. Beautiful Girls: gets almost all guys hating.  Clean sweep.  You realize you might only have a couple of friends.
3. Live at beach in model town: gets all landlocked guys and guys who live in weesh places hating
2. Live life on own terms: gets all office guys hating
"1. Make 500k + per year, (7 figs even better): gets all broke guys hating"
"Guaranteed way 2 get haters:  1. Make 500k + per year, (7 figs even better) 2. Live life on ownterms 3. Live at beach in model town 4. Girls"
"When u walk down the st. in your hood and a 2+ people per block shake your hand, wave etc with a girl its safe to say you will swoop her."

"Having a bad day? Fuck you. Need more money? Get to work.  Unless you arm is trapped in a slot canyon in Blue John Canyon, Dont Bitch."
"Bottom line, you are not really allowed to bitch unless you are trapped in a Chilean Mine or your plane crashes in the Andes Mountains."
"And when you have climbed out of the Grave with dirt on you many times, nothing really can stop you."
"Always said in a trite way, but Failure is the best thing that can happen 2 u  When u have dug yourself out of the grave, u dont give a fuck"

Might lose some people with that Kabardian girl call.  Really innovative shit.
Swooping into some of these beaut EE mixes ie Kabardian-Russian mixes.  Recommend looking into it.    How many guys swoop Kabardian girls?
First time I have written a few paragraphs in about two years.  Wasn't easy:  https://realchristianmcqueen.com/2016/02/16/g-manifesto-interview-part-i/ …
Q: How do you know when you have a spot on Complete Lock Down?  A: When the owner gets jealous of you in his place.  It happens. Trust.
"And ""a portfolio of beautiful girls"" also means different ""instruments"" ie Showgirls, Models, Aerialists,Good Girls etc @WallStPlayboys"
"And by ""a portfolio of beautiful girls 10+ younger"", I mean international diversification, girl ticker symbols EE and SA @WallStPlayboys"
I would take it a step further. If you are a millionaire you need a portfolio of beautiful girls 10+ younger or you failed @WallStPlayboys
Average guy has 0 spots on Lock Down.  Top 80% guy might have 1 weesh spot  Top 90% might 2-3  Apex Man has 5-20 place on complete Lock Down
One of the toughest decisions a Playboy must make is to NOT swoop a beautiful but negative girl on deck.  Let another guy deal with the pain
Celebrities had a way better gig before social media.
".@WallStPlayboys I would say: 1) fat 20%, 2) socially awkward 20%, 3) a dork 30%.  20% all three.  Top 10k easily.  The bar is so low."
"When things are going well, the worst thing you can do is breathe your own exhaust."
Reg guy doesnt understand. & if you are a .001% Male you are going to have 5-50 girls cooking @WallStPlayboys you can become a 0.5% top male
California nightlife is like a remote control that doesnt work.  Basically pointless.
"Ha. Yeah, not even worth a passing thought. @WallStPlayboys ha all good if you read the article you know she's an ugly 4"
".@WallStPlayboys That being said, I do date multiple girls half my age."
".@WallStPlayboys comes down more to genetics and nationalities. A 31 yo Russian ex model is going to be better than 60,000 university girls"
".@Steveonomics @WallStPlayboys Yeah, CA universities are horrible.  My town has 34 year old Victoria Secret models at my gym & on my block."
".@WallStPlayboys Ha, never even been to Chico.  If I would have been that far from the beach for that long I would have got disorientated."
.@WallStPlayboys The 31 year old girls in my town destroy California's universities (I went to the one in CA with the hottest girls).
Harsh reality to the question:  Q:  How do I save more money?  A:  Make more Money
But 10 times + amount of beautiful girls @WallStPlayboys Once you have the big 3 you see a 50%+ reduction in the number of contacts you have
It is true that Men with multiple female options (ie 10-50 +) are always the most positive people and focused on the most positive things.
"If you dont feel the want to clone yourself three or four times + over to swoop all the beaut girls you have cooking, you are doing it wrong"
"Harsh reality:  The Men who dont want to be another man never hate.  Only those ""men"" that want to be someone else or trade places, Hate."
Comparing nightlife of My Town VS California's is like comparing the PH in Trump Tower VS a tent with holes in it on a mean ghetto street.
"California nightlife is like trying to dry off with a wet, cold, sandy towel.  Anyway you look at it, it just sucks."
.@WallStPlayboys the crazy thing is if u have Money and Freedom you are going to have more beautiful girls than u have even time 2 deal with
"The funniest thing about guys with Money, Women, Freedom is they never hate. Too busy making $, swooping and enjoying life. @WallStPlayboys"
"Although the hostility for big 3: Money, Women, Freedom, is always behind closed doors, or on the internet. Not in person @WallStPlayboys"
"If you have all 3, it is complete hostility & loathing  @WallStPlayboys Men will hate you for one of the *big three*: Money, Women, Freedom"
Having a bunch of beaut girls u can swoop during the day are key  Strange no one is talking about the value proposition associated w/ this
"If 99% of regular guys hate you, there is a 99% chance you are doing 100% of the right things."
"Or better yet, do both.  @Cernovich If you don't think men are objectified throw on a custom suit or get a body and see how the world reacts"
"However, in March have so many girls in town, I am literally going 2 have 2 ""Stick and Move"" for 31 straight dayspic.twitter.com/QQ0kdWqXI7"
This year so far have over exceeding in girl production.  Need to turn on Money hose.pic.twitter.com/kIizFWoE2R
Dating a ton of beautiful girls it is almost natural to feel some regret  Realize you are enriching there lives when you are Enlightened Man
"California nightlife is like a friends puppy peeing on your luggage.  Anyway you look at it, you simply just took a loss."
When I was a kid there were guys that did multiple drive by shootings with big body counts with less tattoos than starbucks baristas today
".@WallStPlayboys could be interpreted multiple ways. Cocaine,treacherous females, poison  Playboys are confronted will all ona nightly basis"
"If The Playboy does not avoid the Sirens Call, he will surely end up on the rocks.  Seen it happen.  Again and againpic.twitter.com/fQGhnv8MWe"
The Playboy must always avoid the Sirens call.pic.twitter.com/vhMppDGznz
"Just like there are no atheists in the impact zone, there are no feminists in high end nightlife.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b3_ppzhKv5c …"
"4 an Enlightened Man,the best thing going is all this left vs right, mens rights vs feminist etc fighting  U can coast, make $ & swoop girls"
"Free advice:  If you want to avoid ""feminists"" go to high end nightclubs and restaurants in a model town  You wont find any even if you look"
.@WallStPlayboys True.  And as a single man the number of beautiful girls you should swoop per year is 50 (EE and SA). 100 is even better.
California nightlife is about as fun as emptying a dishwasher.
Never seen a feminist in my town.  Cant relate to all the bitching that guys constantly bitch about them.
"I have learned it is all about having a perfect blend of EE Girls and SA Girls in your life.  And by, a perfect blend, I mean a ton of both."
Fuck the superbowl.    Woke up early for sunrise and surfed some spitting tubes.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYNVwCTMjQw …
Never trade reputation for money.  Its amazing how many people dont get that.
"What the kids these days are calling ""Dead Hang Pull-ups"", we just called ""Pull ups""."
I bet baggy jeans come back   I never understood how those weesh hipster kids carried around a bank roll & few 100 E-Tabs in skinny jeans
"Its important to have a crib where you can swoop girls all over it, not just the bedroom.  Or else you are changing sheets 5-6 days a week."
.@WallStPlayboys and cities with tough doors. U never see packs of guys in my town.They get gutted and bleedout  My town is not guy friendly
.@WallStPlayboys the best cities also have expensive drink prices & high end nightlife  Weeds out chumps & keeps multiple girls for few Men
Hagler shows you how you start a fight.  HUGE.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FcPcDCDRaxI …
"Crazy that Arturo Gatti won ""Fight of the Year"" 4 times.  & Could have won it twice more (Robinson, Ward same year)https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vKObKLdiSPg …"
"I dont know a one guy that is really swooping 3-5 beautiful diff girls per week that ""shares himself on social media"" with photos.  Lesson"
"I always knew that the Custom Suits, Cigarettes, and Heavy Booze would win out over all others.  Above All.  Its timeless."
2007 was not one of those time periods where you think back about how good it was.  It sucked.  What do people want from then?   Auto-Tune?
People really want to go back to the time before Obama?  Anyone remember how bad 2007-2008 was?  Ed Hardy shirts on every dork in the usa?
Two easy steps to success:  1. Live in a Model Town with endless beautiful girls. 2. Become a Top of the Food Chain Man in that town.
"When you stick to a bare knuckles approach ie Booze, Smokes,Custom Suits, $$, Model town, it is amazing how many beaut girls you get cooking"
"Two choices in life.  Ocean, sunshine, $,$$$,$$$, mass amounts of beautiful girls, boxing, surfing.  Or  Who the fuck knows?  Easy choice."
"Think about it, Average guy has 7 sex partners during their life.  Bang that out in a week, you then have time to find cures to 30 diseases."
"If an Average guy has 7 sex partners during their life, my question is this:  Q: What the fuck do they do with all that freetime?"
Average guy has 7 sex partners during their lifetime.  A Playboy has 4-7 on a strong week.  That is why Playboys get so much out of Life.
"Harsh reality:  If you are bitching about girls ""flaking"", the problem isnt with them.  Its with you."
"I kind of get this whole ""Paleo"" thing, but sometimes you just need to throw down a huge Rare Steak Sandwich to get your test flowing."
Credit due to @Cernovich for getting me on juicing.  That and living in my current city have made me 20 years younger.

"Saying ""manosphere sounds like a gay nightclub"" made them all run from term and get ""manosphere"" tattoos covered up.  ""Linguistic Kill Shot"""

"If you yell ""Do you know who I am!"" when a doorman doesnt let you in a nightclub it is pretty safe to say no one wants to know who you are."
"Guys today bitch that ""girls dont want to settle down"".  Harsh reality:  When you are Top of food chain, every girl wants you to settle down"
"If you are making that 7 figs + in a sunny paradise, and those 50 + girls are beautiful Latinas and Russian girls, expect it to be loathing"
Making 7 figures + and swooping 50+ beautiful girls per year is the level where people really hate you.
Every night I go out.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yu8Bnwl6t1c …
"Everywhere you go, you hear people talk about how the world is falling apart  Ask them how much $ they have made off this insight  *Silence*"
Its simple.    You want a lot of $?  Have a ton of big deals in the pipe  You want a lot of girls? Have a ton of beautiful girls in the pipe
"When you have 12+ solid girls in your pipe going into a 7 day week, it is safe to say you will be swooping a ton that week."
It is pretty insane how far speaking a little Russian goes in swooping beautiful Russian girls.  Really starting to wire them.
"Male cheetahs in the Mala Mala, like the Playboy, focus on securing territory.  And with territory comes females.pic.twitter.com/MvfGlYBAj2"
"When people say ""Day Game"" is vital to the success in a city it is just code talk for that cities nightlife is horrible beyond belief."
"The entire fitness industry is a sham.  Show me one guy who boozes 3-5 nights, smokes cigs, drugs AND is in great shape then I will listen."
You can never been to careful in dealing with amateurs.  A poacher that shoots at rabbits might scare big Game away.
All my 3 most successful friends dont have instagram or facebook with their photos online.  Lesson in there somewhere.
"Seriously, what the fuck is a social justice warrior?  I have a feeling they dont hang out in boxing gyms, the beach and high end nightlife."
I honestly still dont even know what the fuck a social justice warrior is.
"People thought me bad before, but if ever I should get free, I'll let them know what bad means. - WHB"

The key is to swoop a bunch of 20 yo girls when you are 60 yo.  That way you are swooping girls half your age till you are 80.  Check Mate.
"At this rate, I could be swooping beautiful 20 year old girls at 60, 70, 80, even 90 years old.   Uncontested."
"Being from my generation and being still on top is a trip. What only the biggest dorks did when I was a kid is now what the ""cool"" kids do."
"When I was a kid first going out, no one wanted their picture taken in a nightclub  Still dont and never have.  Smashed a few cameras though"
"Everyone in the manosphere has ""rich friends"" that dont do well with women.  Strange how manosphere guys are friends with all the rich dorks"
This contempt for money is just another trick of the rich to keep the poor without it.

"The hilarious thing about internet ""game"" guys is how little $ they have  If they had Real Game, they would figure out how to make $, right?"
"People overcomplicate this shit  Day is for Boxing, Surfing, Making $  Night is for Boozing, Smoking and Swooping Beautiful girls  Thats it"
"I attack these nights like Rocky Graziano. Even with a face full of blood, I keep coming till ref pulls me off.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtFo1mvYLY0 …"
I have found that the key is to swoop a lot of beautiful Latinas AND an lot of beaut EE girls  You need Both.That is why my town is so great
In boxing The People want to see the best fight.  In nightlife The People want to see the hottest girls swooped by the smoothest Playboys.

The only slightly unsatisfying threesome with 2 beautiful girls is the one where you had 3 beautiful girls on the table and lost one.
Power  Energy  Harmony  Healing  Intuition  Awareness  Force  Creation  Zen
One certainly could make the argument than NOT spending money on girls and booze IS squandering money.  If one so choose.
I am happy I wasnt born rich.  Endless money and zero work can be disastrous combination.  Although u would probably have mass threeseomes
"However, there really is symmetry and beauty to the ""same nationality threesome"" ie:  Two blonde Russians or two dark haired Colombianas"
I think a real solid move will be EE girl and Latina nationality fusion threesomes.  ie Ukrainian girl and Venezulana  Future of The Game.
Mixed nationality threesomes are the future for sure  Although there is some symmetry and beauty to the one nationality threesome  Thoughts?
I really think the future of threesomes is mixed nationality girls ie:  Russian girl and Colombiana or Cubana and Brasilera or Portena and..

Downside of a threesome with two Colombianas:   Post threesome crib clean up will be intense  Upside:  Its a threesome with two Colombianas

"@WallStPlayboys Well, being old media, that I understand.  So people are buying these followers then?"
@WallStPlayboys That would be like a guy who is 12-0 with more than Mayweather.  Doesnt add up.
@WallStPlayboys How do you explain a legit model (ie represented/famous/products) with 150k and a no name with 800k?
"@thelaplayboy @WallStPlayboys Got it.I know I am not the target market for IG, but on the street, 3 equally hot asses gets same reac from me"
"@WallStPlayboys Yeah, but three equally hot asses is three equally hot asses in my mind. So what gives?  (I am a little ""old media"")"
"I also dont get how three equally hot girls will have 1500 followers, 150000 followers and 1.5m followers respectively.  Anyone know?"

We need to stop with this whole hipster beard trend.  I am having trouble telling white people apart.
Being high profile and glam is good for one beautiful girlfriend.   Low Profile is good for 17 beautiful girlfriends.
There is timing in everything. Timing in strategy cannot be mastered without a great deal of practice.
Money with a Low Profile is true Freedom.  Even most successful people fail to truly grasp that one.
"Think about the all guys at The Top.    Pacquiao? 36. Slater? 43. Hopkins? 50. Mayweather? 38. Klitschko? 39.  Yeah, Men peak at 35.    Ha."

"A lot of guys out there that claim International Playboy.  But the problem is, they are not true students of The International Playboy Life"
Supply and Demand.  There really just arent that many sharp dressed Men with their act together compared to beautiful girls.  Cant lose.
Every Man needs a pull up bar in his home.  And use it everyday.  Simple.  Efficient.
Chris Christie reminds me of that big fat kid in elementary school who talked tough until you bitch slapped him and he ran to the teacher.

@onestep4ward So its true that you are gay. Pretty easy to tell from faux hawk. And your boyfriend.
You actually see a lot of the Trump dorks walking around today with slumped shoulders after @CarlyFiorina 's slapping around of Trump
Funny how @realDonaldTrump got outmaneuvered and slapped around by @CarlyFiorina .  Pretty weak field.

"If someone talks about a ""declining sexual marketplace for guys"" you can bet the ranch he has Tinder on his phone.  And zero Custom Suits."
California nightlife is like the fat guy in the grocery store who doesnt know what the fuck is going on and constantly gets in your way.
We all should be transformed into Gods of compassion or victorious Buddhas.
"Click here to buy our ""VIP package""  - Nothing that great can be bought with a ""click"" @WallStPlayboys"
California nightlife is as pleasurable as running into a spiderweb in your face.
What the fuck is “solipsism” anyway?
I never hear the guys in my town that swoop Model girls talking about “solipsism”and “hypergamy” like manosphere guys  I wonder why that is?

The Way of a Warrior is to establish harmony.
One problem with making a lot of Money is you become acutely aware of the incredibly slow pace the rest of the world operates on.
The Way of a Warrior consists in defeating your adversaries spiritually by making them realize the folly of their actions.
When you get close to pure happiness Life has a tendency to sucker punch you. Or throw an elbow.  Keep defense tight and stay strong.

Great part about getting older is nothing bad fazes you.  Unless your neck is in the jaws of an Polar bear there is nothing to bitch about.
Regular people always ask how they can pay less.  Enlightened Men ask how they can pay more to get it better/faster.  Difference in Mindset
"In my town, every night has the potential to be the greatest night of your life.  If you cant say that where you live, I feel sorry for you."

Another great part about getting older is you know where convos are going if you say something. Important with girls and biz.  Chessboard.
The best part about getting older is you are immune to people's bullshit guilt trips that everyone does.

Never met an unhappy or depressed person that took the time out to watch the Sunrise And the Sunset every day.  Lesson in there somewhere
"And when ""internet gurus"" always report on my Main City and Summer City they completely blow it and go to horrible spots.  Better that way."
Funny that information online about my Main City and Summer City ranges from terrible to wildly inaccurate.  Better that way.
Two types of people say America is the best place on earth:  1. Idiots who never travel 2. Enlightened Men that have traveled for 15+ years

"Trump needs to talk about important issues: Legalizing all drugs, 24 hour bars and nightclubs, smoking everywhere, legalizing gambling etc"
Have to give it up to Trump on the 3rd party run threat.  Power play.

That is the basis of powerful technique.

I am 100% convinced that the earlier the last call time the more people get fucked up.
"Think, El Chapo has hotter/younger wife than @realDonaldTrump, more $, better Global biz and better at construction.  Hard 2 take for Trump"
The real reason @realDonaldTrump is pissed at El Chapo Guzmán is because Chapo pulled off a construction project Trump could never pull off

"True @WallStPlayboys . Golddiggers are the best.  They are the only girls with logical thought.  Plus, have you ever met one that wasnt hot?"
Summertime City you can take beautiful 19 yo girls to dinner and it is comp legal 4 them to drink  Try that in The California Pollice State
Notice how zero comedians are funny?  None of them are single.  Married people arent funny.  Ever.    No matter how hard they try.

"Life itself is always a trial. In training, you must test and polish yourself in order to face the great challenges of life."

"I have never understood why someone would just want ""one"" girl.  It's not like you would just want ""one"" dollar, right?"
Being in great shape should be a given.  Nothing to obsess over.
Money and Girls.  Both highly addictive.  You have to get more and more.
"Ever notice that the internet ""location independent gurus"" are never in good ""locations""?"
Champagne Closes.  So effective.  And style points off the charts.

"Each day of human life contains joy and anger, pain and pleasure, darkness and light, growth and decay."
Met like 30 girls in the last few days in my Summer City.  And they all have the same 5 or so names.  Confusing the hell out of me.
"Last night the club opening I was at was at minimum 7 girls to one guy. Then again, guys bitching about ratios would be able to get in."

A warrior's mind and body must be permeated with enlightened wisdom and deep calm.
Every beautiful girl you get is partially the result of other guys mistakes.  Remember that.

Defeat means to defeat the mind of contention that we harbor within.

I believe you can reach a certain level of Enlightenment by swooping 3+ beautiful girls in the same day. People that disagree havent done it
Its amazing how much you can get away with when you are the one paying for the drinks and you are wearing a Custom Suit.
Breakdown of Playboys:  Trust Fund Playboys: 95%  Street Playboys (made their own $): 5%  However the Street Playboys are alwaysthe greatest
2 kinds of Playboys. Trust Fund Playboys and Street Playboys   I dont hate TFP's but you should know the streets are where my heart is at.

Those with evil intentions or contentious thoughts are instantly vanquished. The Art of Peace is invincible because it contends with nothing

Key to Life:  Figure out what your perfect day and night are and do that every single day and night.  That's what I do.
"Fitness people on internet are all soft.  I want to learn from a fitness cat that smokes, Boozes heavy and still in great shape.  Like me."

"Guy gets married to a woman his age gets ""Congratulations"" from everyone  Man swoops a Model half his age, gets zero ""Congrats""  Accept it."

"I think in the last 6 months I have figured out the Russian girl puzzle.  Which is, as you know, a good puzzle to figure out."
When you meet a negative or depressed guy ask him if he swoops 2-5 beautiful girls per week.  Answer will always be 'no'.  Lesson in there.
Love when you swoop a bunch of girls all week and you can just stay in on a Sat night and watch boxing.
I truly believe that when u sleep with 3 different girls in a day you reach a certain clarity and enlightenment only achieved by doing that
I still have yet to met a guy that bangs 2-5 beautiful girls per week that didnt have an incredible zest for Life  Lesson in there somewhere

"Show me a ""straight"" ""guy"" with an instagram and I will show you a closeted guy at best."
I think I could have one of the best instagrams if I had instagram.  But instagram is super gay and glam to have if you are a straight male
Sunshower shadowboxing on the beach.  Big open ocean swim.  Great way to start day.

Toughest table in town?  Got the reso.
Internet fame or fame in general is not the key. Having local Respect in a world class place is.  On the streets. Make the world come to you
@RealCMcQueen CA's short nightlife clock actually favors the weak.  When there is a long clock the strong rise to the top and swoop the most
@RealCMcQueen With way better quality.That is why guys in Los Mangeles always date and have girlfriends. Its just not set up for volume.
"@RealCMcQueen The real issue in Los Mangeles is the police state. If a guy gets 30 girls a year in ca, he can do 60 in a better place"
"Which in turn makes other better places have more girls than guys. California guys suffer, the rest of us prosper.But they do have good guac"
The greatest thing about California is it traps such a huge amount of guys in a place and tricks them thinking it should be good.
"Have you ever give Man Francisco, Man Diego or Orange Manty as shot?@TheQuestForever  never really been happy and at peace in Los Mangeles."
"Responsibility. Redemption.   In order to be truly redeemed, a Man has to own up to his responsibilities."
"The best thing about my Block is if you control it, you control the world.  A model doesn't walk on it without me knowing."

"If you have Money and Health, nothing can stand in your way."
"However, my hood is pretty special. I could go to Ukraine or I could walk across the street and talk to a girl that competed in Miss Ukraine"

Fact:    People that say that money doesn't help your Game have never gone out at night with $3000 in their pocket.
Do you really think instagram would even exist if there were strong Father Figures in this world?

Every pro fighter I know past and present had Marquez winning.
And we got Cotto VS Margarito.  Might be the best fight of the year.
"I guess it worked out for the best.  Marquez won, but we still get Mayweather VS Pacman.  Win-Win."
"great point @loudibella Three guys won tonight, Marquez, Floyd and Sergio Martinez."
I think any true connoisseur of boxing had Marquez winning.
audio problem in the ring.  typical.
Pac and Marquez need a fourth fight
The Judges botched it again.
they need a fourth @LennoxLewis Is three fights enough? #pacmarquez #pacjm
Lampley lobbying for Pacman
fight could easily go to either fighter.  A draw is possible too.
Very well could come down to final round.  Unless the judges throw up an airball.
"Lampley, Kellerman and Lederman must be on PacMans payroll.  Pacman cut."
Round 9:  Great stuff.  Pac and Marquez = two scorpions in a bottle #twoscorpionsinabottle
Marquez winning.  I could easily see the judges botch this one.
Marquez using pinpoint counters.  Manny takes a great punch.  Never shows he is hurt.
Marquez's pace and tempo so far.  Manny looks good though.
Marquez settling down and feeling it in round 5.
Some truth.  However Pac V Marquez+Cotto V Margarito are two best sporting events of the year @Forbes Down Goes Boxinghttp://onforb.es/sqtidX
